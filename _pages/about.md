The phrase "I should have taken a left turn at Albuquerque" is a catchphrase <a target="_blank" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bugs_Bunny" rel="nofollow"><b>Bugs Bunny</b></a> often says when he finds himself in a difficult or compromising situation. The phrase is meant to be humorous and suggests that Bugs Bunny took a wrong turn somewhere, leading him to his current predicament. The expression is closely associated with Bugs Bunny and used as a reference to the character and his mischievous nature.
